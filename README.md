Belgian Zip and NIS codes.
==========================

Scripts to join Belgian zipcodes and NIS codes.

Input is in the `data` folder (can be redownloaded from their sources using the `Makefile`).

Output (the one you care about) in the `out` folder.

You'll need these if you want to make choropleths: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606
